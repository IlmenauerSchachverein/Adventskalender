The North Pole hums with energy as the elves prepare for another Christmas season. Inside Santa's Factory, gears whir and lights flash as thousands of toys roll off assembly lines. But something feels... off.

David Snowell, one of Santa's top engineer elves, bursts into the main hall where you and Wesley Snow are chatting by the candy cane dispenser. "We’ve got a problem," David says, holding up a blinking red device. "There’s an anomaly in the Temporal Singularity Chamber."

The elves fall silent. The TSC is the heart of the operation, containing the black hole that slows time for the factory. Without it, the elves wouldn’t have enough time to produce billions of gifts before Christmas.

David leads you to the TSC control room. On the monitors, you see distorted readings and glitching images of the black hole. Beside the control panel, a chess position and a torn santa mask.

"This must be Grinchuk," Wesley says. "He’s back."

David nods. "We’ve got to stabilize the TSC before it collapses. The first step is getting to this position after White's 6th move."
