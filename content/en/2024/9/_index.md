The rhythmic hum grows louder as you make your way toward the sealed chamber at the back of the lab. David stops at a nearby console, pulling up schematics. "The Cryostasis Chamber," he mutters. "It’s where we keep Santa frozen between Christmases."

Wesley blinks in confusion. "Frozen? Why?"

David types rapidly, bringing up files on the display. "Santa’s no elf. He doesn’t have centuries to spare like we do. Cryostasis keeps him in perfect condition for the next Christmas. He only wakes up to prepare for his yearly trip and goes back into stasis when the work is done."

Magnus raises an eyebrow. "Seems... extreme."

David shrugs. "It’s how he’s managed to deliver presents for generations without aging like the rest of us."

Puzzled, you approach the chamber, while the air growing colder. A warning light flashes on the control panel. "That’s odd," David says, frowning. "The system shouldn’t be active yet. Santa’s not supposed to wake up until December 24th."

Magnus steps forward, examining the panel. "Then why is it humming like it’s working overtime?"

David glances at you. "Something’s off. We need to get in there. The password to getting in is the moves to reach this position from the initial position."
