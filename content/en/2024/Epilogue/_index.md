As the group walks back toward the factory, a faint ping comes from David’s scanner. He pauses, frowning. "That shouldn’t be possible. The TSC just sent a signal."

Magnus turns. "A signal? From where?"

David’s voice is almost a whisper. "The future. One hundred years from now."

The screen displays a single line of text:
"Seek the bell tower. – Wesley Snow"

The group exchanges glances, the weight of the message sinking in. Magnus breaks the silence, his voice steady. "We’ll remember. And we’ll be ready."

The snow falls silently as the message fades, leaving only the stars above and the quiet hum of the Temporal Singularity Chamber.
