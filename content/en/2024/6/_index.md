After Magnus Carolsen's challenge, David Snowell rushes in from the corridor, his face pale. "You need to see this."

An image appears on the screen, chess players appearing for a split second at a time before disappearing. Pieces assembling on a board. Magnus steps forward, his eyes narrowing. "That's... Capablanca. And that's Lasker. This is their game from 1921. What’s it doing here?"

Before anyone can answer, the board glitches, and something stranger happens. A square flickers into existence next to the chessboard, detached from any file or rank. "What is that?" Wesley asks, staring.

David tilts his head. "It’s... impossible. That’s a square where no square should be. It’s like spacetime is warping, creating fragments that don’t belong. This must be tied to the singularity’s interference."

The board flickers again, pieces rearranging themselves into a new position. The detached square glows faintly, as if waiting to be anchored. A faint hum resonates through the corridor. "That's the restricted section," David explains, pointing at the door at the end of the corridor. "If we figure out where that square belongs, it might just be the key to opening it."

Add one square to the edge of the board, directly above, below, left, or right of an existing square. Then White moves first, mating in 2. First, specify the location of the new square. For example, write a0 or a9 if it’s below a1 or above a8, i2 if it’s to the right of h2, or z5 if it’s to the left of a5 (use z for squares left of the a-file). Once the square is added, provide the sequence of moves leading to a forced mate in 2.
